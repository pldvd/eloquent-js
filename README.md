# eloquent-js
This repo contains my solutions for the exercises found in this great JavaScript book called 'Eloquent JavaScript' by Marijn Haverbeke, one of my favourite books on JS. The file names in the repo correspond to chapter names and within these I have included only the exercises found at the end of each chapter. All work is mine unless stated otherwise in a comment.
